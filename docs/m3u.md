# M3U Multi-Disc Management

You can streamline the file browsing experience by organizing game CD files using M3U playlists. When you place game ROM files into a folder and create an M3U file listing all the corresponding game CD files, the frontend's file browser will automatically display only the M3U file while hiding the individual game CD files listed within it. This approach simplifies identifying the correct files to execute, ensuring a cleaner and more organized interface, especially when dealing with multi-disc games or collections of CD-based games.

The following is an example of this feature using PlayStation **Colony Wars** two disc game:
