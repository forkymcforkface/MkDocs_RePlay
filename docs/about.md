My name is Rubén Tomás (AKA RTA or rTomas). I love classic games and emulation, but what I like the most, is bringing gaming experiences back to your modern LCD or vintage CRT TVs.

I'm a C, Python, HTML/JavaScript programmer. My main focus is on creating custom frontends for Raspberry Pi devices. I also contribute on the development and bugfixing of several core emulators, Linux kernel and drivers, and more.

I'm also the creator of **RGB-Pi OS 1/2/4**
