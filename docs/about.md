My name is Rubén Tomás Alonso (AKA RTA or rTomas). I'm a C, Python, HTML/JavaScript programmer with focus on creating custom frontends for Raspberry Pi devices. I also contribute on the development and bugfixing of several core emulators, Linux kernel, drivers, and more.

BTW I'm also the creator of RGB-Pi OS 1/2/4!
