## What is RePlay OS?

**RePlay OS** is a Linux distribution featuring a streamlined [libretro](./faq.md/#what-is-libretro) frontend. It's specifically designed to emulate a wide range of classic game consoles, arcade machines, and computers. The OS focuses on delivering fast and user-friendly emulation experiences, optimized for use with Raspberry Pi boards. This emphasis on ease of use and broad compatibility makes it an ideal choice for enthusiasts looking to relive classic gaming moments on modern hardware.

RePlay OS is meant to be executed only in Raspberry Pi devices. Putting the focus on a single device allows me to bring the best emulation experience for both LCD and CRT TVs.
