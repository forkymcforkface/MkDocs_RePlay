# Keyboard Configuration

RePlay OS was designed with joysticks and gamepads as first-class citizens. While several computer emulators are supported, the system's primary target is arcade machines and video game consoles. Consequently, computer support is limited to gamepad/joystick compatibility, with the keyboard serving only as a fallback method for UI navigation and specific internal features, which are detailed in the table below:
