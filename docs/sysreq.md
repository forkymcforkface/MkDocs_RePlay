# Requirements

**Hardware:**

* Raspberry Pi Zero 2
* Raspberry Pi 3A/B/B+
* Raspberry Pi 4B
* Raspberry Pi 5B

    **NOTE:** please check the [Supported System](./systems.md#compatibility-matrix) section to see which systems can be emulated depending on the Raspberry Pi model.

    **CRT/JAMMA Users:** the system is being developed using new RGB-Pi prototype hardware (new hardware will be announced in the comming months), and no other devices will be supported or tested.

**Case:**

* We reccommend the official Raspberry Pi or metal Argon cases to ensure the best cooling.

    **NOTE:** all cases will work without requiring any modification when using the new RGB-Pi cable CRT TV hardware.

**Power adapter:**

* We reccommend the official Raspberry Pi (5.1V/3.0A) or Argon (5.25V/3.5A) power adapters to ensure the best performance, and avoid power drops and CPU throttling.

**Storage:**

* (Required) MicroSD card (A2 U3) 8GB+ or better for system installation.
* (Optional) USB3 pendrive or SSD USB3 external drive for ROMs, BIOS, saves, and config files.

    **NOTE:** you can also use the MicroSD card for storing all your ROMs, BIOS, saves, and config files.

**Game Controllers**

* Please read the [Gamepad Configuration](gpadbasic.md) section for further details.
